This project was scaffolded using [chapi-chapi/generator-angular](https://github.com/chapi-chapi/generator-angular)

This is a component library for various angular packages.
The project acts as a runnable application that can also be used to generate individual npm packages.
To run locally use:

```npm run start```

This will run a build --watch against all projects and also serve the app in parallel.
